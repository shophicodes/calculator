# Calculator
This project is from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and it was written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
## Known Issues
1) After user divides by zero, an error will display. That's fine. However, user still can use other operations to do with that "message", eventually resulting in "NaN".
2) This calculator doesn't have keyboard support yet.
